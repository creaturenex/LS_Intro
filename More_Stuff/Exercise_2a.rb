# What will the following program print to the screen? What will it return?

def execute(&block)
  block
end

execute { puts 'Hello from inside the execute method!' }

puts "Code before watching video

I do not think I grasp procs
a block is a collection of code
a proc is just a block saved to a varible
In a proc, it will not execute the block unless its followed by '.cal'"

puts "Code after watching video
In Exercise_2a.rb the proc itself does not have the '.call' method as a result
it will not execute the block in the (parenthesis)

I created Exercise_2b.rb with the '.call' method and when we execute that
program it puts 'Hello from inside the execute method!'"
