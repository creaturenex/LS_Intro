# Hashes/Exercise_7.rb

# Given the following code...

# x = "hi there"
# my_hash = {x: "some value"}
# my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

puts "Code before watching video

my_hash = {x: 'some value'}
yields {:x=>'some value'}

while

my_hash2 = {x => 'some value'}
{'hi there'=>'some value'}

In my_hash the :x is expressed as a symbol, hence we see 'x' as the key.

In my_hash2 the x is expressed as a varible because it is missing the ':' and x = 'hi there' so store varible is expressed in the key.

after watching the video, my assesment is inline"
