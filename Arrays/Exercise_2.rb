# What will the following programs return? What is value of arr after each

1. arr = ["b", "a"]
   arr = arr.product(Array(1..3)) # this one is in parenthesis
   arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)







2. arr = ["b", "a"]
   arr = arr.product([Array(1..3)]) # this one is in brackets
   arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)

   puts "Code before watching video"



   [[b, 1], [b, 2], [b, 3], [a, 1], [a, 2], [a, 3]]

   [[b, 2], [b, 3], [a, 1], [a, 2], [a, 3]]
